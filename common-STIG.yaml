# === PKI Options ===
# Where to source the PKI infrastructure certs. Here, we’ll use the Puppet
# agent certs since # they work out of the box and are managed by the
# Puppet Master’s CA. Note, this is only ideal in a production environment
if
# the Puppet Master is configured with FIPS mode on in the kernel AND the
# master’s hardware has a TPM.
#
# If you have your own way for distributing keys to systems, you can set
the
# path on the local system here and Puppet will ensure they are configured
# for all the various services that require the PKI infrastructure.
#
# Please note that any key content changes enforced by Puppet will appear
in
# the Puppet reports, so ensure access to PuppetDB is tightly controlled.

# === SSSD Options ===
# If you want to use sssd, you can enable it here.
# Be sure to uncomment the LDAP domain if you enable LDAP below
use_sssd: false
sssd::domains :
 - “LOCAL”
# - “LDAP”
# === Purge unmanaged configurations ===
# Purge all unmanaged resources for each of the listed
# resource types. Once you’re managing all the yumrepos
# and users in Puppet, uncomment the user and yumrepo types.
compliance::profile::purge_unmanaged_resource_types:
 - ‘firewall’
# - ‘user’
# - ‘yumrepo’
# === LDAP Options ===
# Various LDAP-related settings. You *really* want to make sure that
# these are set since multiple modules use them.
#
# Remember that you can’t include hiera arrays or hashes later on,
# only string values!
#
# If you disable this, then modules will not attempt to use LDAP where
# possible.

# === Rsync Options ===
#
# Several modules use rsync as a means of pulling down large
# collections of files. This provides a single point of configuration
# for the system defaults.
#
# Individual modules can be overridden as required
#
# By default the rsync server is 127.0.0.1, with an stunnel
# connecting to the puppet server (default seen below). If you wish
# to change the rsync server, uncomment and modify rsync_stunnel
# as needed.

# Default runlevel
#
# This sets the default runlevel the systems should boot to.
# The default is 3
